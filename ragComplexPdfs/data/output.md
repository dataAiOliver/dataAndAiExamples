# UBER Financial Performance Q4 2022

# UBER Financial Performance Q4 2022

## Financial Highlights

Revenue of $2.9 billion: Delivery Revenue grew 21% YoY and 6% QoQ. Take Rate of 20.5% grew 250 bps YoY and grew 30 bps
QoQ. Business model changes in some countries that classify certain payments and incentives as cost of revenue benefited
Delivery Take Rate by 480 bps in the quarter (compared to 410 bps benefit in Q4 2021 and 500 bps benefit in Q3 2022).

Adjusted EBITDA of $241 million: Delivery Adjusted EBITDA grew $216 million YoY and $60 million QoQ, driven by higher
volumes, increased Advertising revenue, and improved network efficiencies. Delivery Adjusted EBITDA margin as a percentage
of Gross Bookings reached 1.7%, compared to 0.2% in Q4 2021 and 1.3% in Q3 2022.

Revenue of $1.5 billion: Freight Revenue grew 43% YoY and declined 12% QoQ. Freight Revenue includes contributions from
the acquisition of Transplace which closed on November 12, 2021.

Adjusted EBITDA loss of $8 million: Freight Adjusted EBITDA grew $17 million YoY but declined $9 million QoQ. Freight
Adjusted EBITDA margin as a percentage of Gross Bookings improved 1.8 percentage points YoY to (0.5)% driven by increased
marketplace efficiency on our digital platform and strong sales momentum in our Transportation Management business.

Corporate G&A and Platform R&D expenses of $580 million, compared to $489 million in Q4 2021, and $564 million in Q3 2022.
On a YoY basis, Corporate G&A and Platform R&D remained flat as a percentage of Gross Bookings.

## Costs and Operating Expenses

Cost of revenue excluding D&A: GAAP cost of revenue equaled non-GAAP cost of revenue and was $5.3 billion, representing
17.3% of Gross Bookings, compared to 12.0% and 17.7% in Q4 2021 and Q3 2022, respectively. On a YoY basis, non-GAAP cost
of revenue as a percentage of Gross Bookings increased due to the classification of certain Delivery and Mobility payments as
cost of revenue attributable to business model changes in some countries and the acquisition of Transplace.

GAAP and Non-GAAP operating expenses (Non-GAAP operating expenses exclude certain amounts as further detailed in the
�Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures� section):

- Operations and support: GAAP operations and support was $605 million. Non-GAAP operations and support was $564
million, representing 1.8% of Gross Bookings, compared to 2.0% in both Q4 2021 and Q3 2022. On a YoY basis, non-GAAP
operations and support as a percentage of Gross Bookings decreased due to improved fixed cost leverage.
- Sales and marketing: GAAP sales and marketing was $1.1 billion. Non-GAAP sales and marketing was $1.1 billion,
representing 3.6% of Gross Bookings, compared to 4.8% and 3.9% in Q4 2021 and Q3 2022, respectively. On a YoY basis,
non-GAAP sales and marketing as a percentage of Gross Bookings decreased due to a decrease in consumer discounts, rider
facing loyalty expense, promotions, credits and refunds.
- Research and development: GAAP research and development was $747 million. Non-GAAP research and development was
$452 million, representing 1.5% of Gross Bookings, compared to 1.4% and 1.6% in Q4 2021 and Q3 2022, respectively. As a
percentage of Gross Bookings, non-GAAP research and development increased on a YoY basis due to higher employee costs,
but decreased on a QoQ basis with slower headcount growth.
- General and administrative: GAAP general and administrative was $745 million. Non-GAAP general and administrative was
$523 million, representing 1.7% of Gross Bookings, compared to 1.8% and 1.7% in Q4 2021 and Q3 2022, respectively. On a
YoY basis, non-GAAP general and administrative as a percentage of Gross Bookings decreased due to improved fixed cost
leverage.

## Operating Highlights for Q4 2022

Monthly Active Platform Consumers (�MAPCs�) reached 131 million: MAPCs grew 11% YoY and 6% QoQ to 131 million, driven by
continued improvement in consumer activity for our Mobility offerings. Mobility MAPCs reached an all-time high of over 100
million.

Trips of 2.1 billion: Trips on our platform grew 19% YoY and 8% QoQ, driven by Mobility and Delivery growth.

Membership: Launched our single cross-platform membership program, Uber One, in Chile, France, Japan, Spain and Taiwan.
Uber One is now available across 12 countries. In addition, announced a new offer for Capital One cardholders to get up to
24 months of free Uber One plus 10x cash back benefits. Our global member base nearly doubled YoY to nearly 12 million.

Adjusted EBITDA measure to the closest corresponding GAAP measure without unreasonable efforts because we are unable to predict
the ultimate outcome of certain significant items. These items include, but are not limited to, significant legal settlements,
unrealized gains and losses on equity investments, tax and regulatory reserve changes, restructuring costs and acquisition and
financing related impacts.
