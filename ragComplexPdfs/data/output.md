## About Uber

Uber�s mission is to create opportunity through movement. We started in 2010 to solve a simple problem: how do you get access to a ride at the touch of a button? More than 37 billion trips later, we're building products to get people closer to where they want to be. By changing how people, food, and things move through cities, Uber is a platform that opens up the world to new possibilities.

## Forward-Looking Statements

This press release contains forward-looking statements regarding our future business expectations which involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by terms such as �anticipate,� �believe,� �contemplate,� �continue,� �could,� �estimate,� �expect,� �hope,� �intend,� �may,� �might,� �objective,� �ongoing,� �plan,� �potential,� �predict,� �project,� �should,� �target,� �will,� or �would� or similar expressions and the negatives of those terms.

Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors relate to, among others: competition, managing our growth and corporate culture, financial performance, investments in new products or offerings, our ability to attract drivers, consumers and other partners to our platform, our brand and reputation, other legal and regulatory developments, particularly with respect to our relationships with drivers and couriers and the impact of the global economy, including rising inflation and interest rates.

For additional information on other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted, please see our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022 and subsequent annual reports, quarterly reports and other filings filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time.

## Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To supplement our financial information, which is prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (�GAAP�), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted EBITDA; Free cash flow; Free cash flow, excluding HMRC VAT claims settlement; Non-GAAP Costs and Operating Expenses as well as, revenue growth rates in constant currency.

This document contains the quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

For more information on non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to the sections titled �Key Terms for Our Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures,� �Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures,� and �Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures� included at the end of this release.

Regarding forward-looking non-GAAP guidance, Uber is unable to reconcile the forward-looking non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA measure to the closest corresponding GAAP measure without unreasonable efforts due to the unpredictability of certain significant items. These items may include significant legal settlements, unrealized gains and losses on equity investments, tax and regulatory reserve changes, restructuring costs, and acquisition and financing impacts.
